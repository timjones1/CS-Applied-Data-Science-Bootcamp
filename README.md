# Prediction of Risk Profile for Insurance Company

This dataset was published by an insurance company and contains anonymised information about their clients.

The aim is to determine people's risk profile (from 1 to 8) based on their features.

Although risk profile is ordered, we consider this problem as being a classification problem and the overall accuracy will be used for evaluating your model.

**Notes**:

- this dataset has been thoroughly anonymized, which makes it extra challenging.
- this is a dataset with low signal, and a 8-classes classification problem, hence accuracy can be quite low.

## Get the data

We provide a file, `run.py` that you can use to manage the project. To download the data in the right place; in a terminal run:

```python
python run.py setup
```
from within the repository.

This will download three files:
* `X_train.zip`: the training set as a csv file. Note that the file is zipped but NO NEED TO UNZIP it, you can simply call `pd.read_csv("data/X_train.zip")` to open it, saving space on disk. 

It contains the following features:

**Variable - Description**
- Id - A unique identifier associated with an application.
- Product_Info_1-7 - A set of normalized variables relating to the product applied for
- Ins_Age - Normalized age of applicant
- Ht - Normalized height of applicant
- Wt - Normalized weight of applicant
- BMI - Normalized BMI of applicant
- Employment_Info_1-6 - A set of normalized variables relating to the employment history of the applicant.
- InsuredInfo_1-6 - A set of normalized variables providing information about the applicant.
- Insurance_History_1-9 - A set of normalized variables relating to the insurance history of the applicant.
- Family_Hist_1-5 - A set of normalized variables relating to the family history of the applicant.
- Medical_History_1-41 - A set of normalized variables relating to the medical history of the applicant.
- Medical_Keyword_1-48 - A set of dummy variables relating to the presence of/absence of a medical keyword being associated with the application.
- Response - This is the target variable, an ordinal variable relating to the final decision associated with an application

**The following variables are all categorical (nominal):**
```
Product_Info_1, Product_Info_2, Product_Info_3, Product_Info_5, Product_Info_6, Product_Info_7, Employment_Info_2, Employment_Info_3, Employment_Info_5, InsuredInfo_1, InsuredInfo_2, InsuredInfo_3, InsuredInfo_4, InsuredInfo_5, InsuredInfo_6, InsuredInfo_7, Insurance_History_1, Insurance_History_2, Insurance_History_3, Insurance_History_4, Insurance_History_7, Insurance_History_8, Insurance_History_9, Family_Hist_1, Medical_History_2, Medical_History_3, Medical_History_4, Medical_History_5, Medical_History_6, Medical_History_7, Medical_History_8, Medical_History_9, Medical_History_11, Medical_History_12, Medical_History_13, Medical_History_14, Medical_History_16, Medical_History_17, Medical_History_18, Medical_History_19, Medical_History_20, Medical_History_21, Medical_History_22, Medical_History_23, Medical_History_25, Medical_History_26, Medical_History_27, Medical_History_28, Medical_History_29, Medical_History_30, Medical_History_31, Medical_History_33, Medical_History_34, Medical_History_35, Medical_History_36, Medical_History_37, Medical_History_38, Medical_History_39, Medical_History_40, Medical_History_41
```

**The following variables are continuous:**
```
Product_Info_4, Ins_Age, Ht, Wt, BMI, Employment_Info_1, Employment_Info_4, Employment_Info_6, Insurance_History_5, Family_Hist_2, Family_Hist_3, Family_Hist_4, Family_Hist_5
```

**The following variables are discrete:**
```
Medical_History_1, Medical_History_10, Medical_History_15, Medical_History_24, Medical_History_32
Medical_Keyword_1-48 are dummy variables.
```

* `y_train.zip`: the target for our training set, corresponds to all the classes we are trying to predict. 

* `X_test.zip`: A sample test dataframe to test your model locally.


## Get Started

You will need to implement the function `build_model` in `model.py` and use the `run.py` to train your model and save its state to a file.

Check the Machine Learning help page on KATE for more details on how to do so.


## Baseline Model

```
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier


class Processor(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self

    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        cols = ["Product_Info_4"]

        if y is None:
            return X[cols]

        return X[cols], y


def build_model():
    preprocessor = Processor()
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    return Pipeline([("preprocessor", preprocessor), ("model", model)])
```

Good luck!
