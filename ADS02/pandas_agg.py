    Write a function that takes a pandas.DataFrame with four
    columns: "category", "price", "weight", "in_stock"
    and returns a pandas.Series containing the price of the heaviest weight
    per category of items still in stock.You can assume that no items in the
    same category have the same weight to make things simpler to reason about.
    The returned Series should not have an index name and the values should be
    sorted in descending order.You should return an empty Series if there are
    not items in stock for all categories.

    Example input:

        category      price weight  in_stock

    first two quarters of 2018 for a particular city. This function should
    return a new DataFrame containing three columns: "location","Date","Value"

    particular date. The returned pandas.DataFrame should sort the values by
    location first and then by temperature measurement. It should also drop
    any missing values and reset the index of the returned DataFrame.

def compute_events_matrix_count(events):

    Write a function that takes a pandas.DataFrame containing 2 columns

    This function should return a new DataFrame where each event value becomes

    event for each userid. Missing values should be filled with 0.
    Effectively, this function calculates the number of occurrence for each
    event type (columns) for each user (rows).
    You should return an empty Series if the input DataFrame is empty.
